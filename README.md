# Flask-Bower-Grunt

## Installation

	You need to have nodeJS, npm, Grunt, Bower and Git installed on the system before you proceed:

	`$ source venv/bin/activate`

## Documentation

  	Flask needs a development server to run in order to serve the application. To do so, run `$ python server.py`. And to make Grunt minify your JS files, run (in a separate terminal tab) `$ grunt`. Your application will be available at `127.0.0.1:5000`.
